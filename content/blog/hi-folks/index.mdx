Most of my recent work, the projects I most enjoyed working on have been built on Gatsby, so I figured it was about time to update the ol' personal site with my favorite static React site generator.

## What's under the hood?

I started with `gatsby-starter-blog-mdx` and made some modifications to the way blog entries are
handled. I want to be able to categorize posts between web development, game making, and any other
category that I may fancy writing about.

## What did I learn?

### `gatsby-mdx` is pretty flexible

To be able to categorize posts I needed to make sure I had a way to infer the post structure.

My first approach was to
query everything and filter the results based on the file path with a regex. The
starter organizes mdx content under `/content/blog` so I figured I could add `/content/work` to
categorize content related to client and personal work. But this didn't get picked up right away. It
requires adding the folder to `gatsby-config.js` so that it gets picked up by the `file-system`
gatsby source first. The easy fix here is to instead add a root folder, with subfolders under it eg.
`/content/writing/blog` and `/content/writing/work` and configure `/content/writing` to get picked
up.

Still, regex file path matching feels pretty ugly and clumsy, and it's too restrictive of an approach. I'd
rather have a multi-tag system that would allow writing to be categorized in a variety of ways. Who
knows what kind of writing I'll end up doing here, so I don't want to box myself in to force every
post to be about a singular topic.

Next I looked around at what is supported by the `allMdx` query, which I wasn't able to find much
documentation for, but thankfully GraphQL is sort of self documenting so I was able to explore the
interface with GraphiQL and find

```
TODO put in video here
```

Hey would you look at that! The arbitrary frontmatter data I've added is queryable. That's great,
looks like this will work out perfectly.

### Signs of `gatsby-mdx`'s Immaturity

#### Incomplete Documentation

While flexible and robust, the fact that I needed to hunt around on my own to discover this
fairly common feature highlights some of the weakspots of the gatsby-mdx ecosystem. The
documentation site has a lot of pages that just say `TODO`.

#### Early Windows Support

Poor Windows support in package tooling usually stems from very simple assumptions coded in about
environment variables or file paths.

Spinning up `gatsby-starter-blog-mdx` raised an error on Windows about not finding a file. An
issue has already been raised, and the underlying bug in `gatsby-mdx` was fixed, but it just needed
to be upgraded in the starter. An easy fix, but a frustrating bump to run into nonetheless.


## What's next?

Well, now that I have a nice little system for categorizing my writing, I just need to... actually
do some more writing :)
